## About this project
This was my capstone project at the end of my five-month, full-time [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com) bootcamp. I created a reading log iOS app inspired by Goodreads. Part of my goal was to get experience with the native iOS toolchain, so I wrote this app completely in SwiftUI.

### MVP
- The app must compile and run on iOS
- The app must store a collection of books
- The user must have CRUD control over that collection of books

### Technologies Used
- Xcode: Apple’s IDE
- Swift: Apple-crafted open-source language
- SwiftUI: Apple’s next generation declarative UI framework

## Using the App
- Start by making sure that Xcode is installed and updated. This requires a computer that runs MacOS. 
- Download this repository.
- Open the project in Xcode, then make sure you change the developer setting to your own AppleID or developer account. 
- Choose a deployment target or simulator, then run build. 

## Development Roadmap
As much fun as I had creating this app concept, I will not be continuing to develop it. I think SwiftUI is the future because the declarative paradigm has so many advantages in a multi-device, multiplatform world. As it stands, it's just too difficult for a new to iOS developer to use. I plan to continue learning Swift and iOS development by starting with UIKit based courses before coming back to SwiftUI.
